# Shell Scripting Practice Series

This repository contains my personal Bash scripting practice tasks (1–8) developed as part of my DevOps learning journey.  
Each task focuses on building strong automation fundamentals, moving step by step from the basics of shell scripting to more advanced topics like modular design and automation logic.

## Task Overview

| Task Range | Focus | Key Concepts |
|-------------|--------|--------------|
| 1–3 | Basics | Date and time display, user input, loops, simple logging |
| 4–6 | Intermediate | Functions, log automation, modular scripting |
| 7 | In progress | Backup automation and structured error handling |
| 8 | Advanced Concepts | Function exit status, modular design |
| 9–20 | Planned | Docker, GitHub Actions, and cloud-based automation |

---

## Tech Stack
Bash | Linux | Git | GitHub Actions (planned) | Docker (planned)

Each script runs directly in the terminal and logs outputs to files where required.  
All scripts have been tested on Ubuntu and verified for basic automation workflows.
